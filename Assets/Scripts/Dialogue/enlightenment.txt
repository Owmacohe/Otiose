How many have played this game before me? Am I worthy of it?
Clearly, the bounds of this world are just an inverted sphere
Oh boy I sure do love escapism beyond my control!
What is a popup message, but an imposition of an outer will?
The time for pretentiousness is upon you
When the game is turned off, the figures sleep in your mind
