[FIRST]

Oh, jolly day to you loyal subject! Truly all is well in our crafted world! I am lord of all that is forgotten in excitement. I am Raja, The King! Come, frolic with me among the field of immersion. It is through total subsumation to our individual performances that we achieve true harmony!

[REPEATED]

Your performance excites me, passionate one! What performance you ask? Oh, merely teh joy of unfettered existance, here in this place. Here we are not bound to cynicism, and this is good.

[HAT]

The splendor of your hat is wonderful, my friend. You wear it nobly, as a player of this proverbial stage. I do say, your thesbian efforts are ripe with commodification! It is through performance that we shall redeem our excitement and income, don't you agree? See now as you reap the benefits of forward thinking!
