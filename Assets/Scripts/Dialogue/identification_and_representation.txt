[FIRST]

Finally, you have found me. In the steps of I, Shakata, The Chariot, you have walked. Have you seen yourself among them, the faces of the others?
Their self-awareness, but also their self-sublimation? Yet you are still not satisfied. The body you inhabit is still not yours. Or perhaps it always was.

[REPEATED]

Between a fear of technical ignorance and the creeping dread of ambivalence you are flung. I know you're scared. We all are. I hope that I'm seen through this construct.
I hope you look through and acknowledge yourself.

[HAT]

The brim of scholars rests upon your head. The Wizard Hat. It's a vessel you know; a way to move beyond this imperfect viewing. Would you wish to leave now, learning all you have?
If representation is what you seek, look no further than my companions here in this void. They are you, and you them. Take heed of that knowledge, and leave now.
