[FIRST]

Hello. Dear character. In a facsimiled world you find yourself. I wonder, does this experience please you? Does it convince you?
I am Bhata, The Pawn. Lowliest wanderer of the representative void. You would do well to heed my words and remember: We Are All But Signifiers.
This place, while tangible in the mind, speaks to something else. As do you, dear character. I know what you are.

[REPEATED]

You would do well to remember my words. Only through true understanding of the metaphorical platform on which we stand can we hold it in entirety. Embrace the fracture of immersion.

Ah, I see you don the ballcap. Truly, its presence in this experience is fortuitous. Itâ€™s inherent ubiquity, its lack of major signification amuses me.
In a world of signs and symbols such as this, the unmarked is glorious. I can see that you appreciate the semiotics of our digital experience.
As a token of my gratitude, please, experience the true nature of existence for a while, by my hand.
